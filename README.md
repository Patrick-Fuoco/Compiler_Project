üëã Welcome to my Compiler Project! This compiler tackles a custom language defined by our professor. I chose to write it using the Java programming language as this is what I am most familiar with. It consists of:  
1. Lexical Analyzer  
2. Syntactic Parser (CST builder)  
3. Semantic Parser (AST builder)

‚ö° How It Works  
Tokenize: Lexical analyzer converts source code into tokens defined by the custom progamming language.  
Parse: Syntaxtic Parser checks if the tokens follow the rules of the grammar, and builds the CST.  
Analyze: Semantic Parser creates a tree that retains semantic meaning, getting the compiler ready for symbol-table generation, which is the fourth phase of compilation and the introduction to the "back-end" unit!  

üå≥ Final Result: Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)  
The AST represents your code in tree form (think of it like a blueprint üõ†Ô∏è).  
Each node represents things like variables, functions, loops, and more! 

‚ùóThis AST should then undergo two more compilation phases which were not included in my project (Symbol table generation and Code generation.)
